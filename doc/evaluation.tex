\chapter{Introduction}

Given the iterative, \emph{Agile} approach taken in developing the app,
user demoing and evaluation was able to take place at each iteration of the
software. It is with this regular feedback that the development is able
to adapt to user needs and suggestions. It is not uncommon for planned
features then to be dropped or prioritised differently after each
iteration demo.

It is with this methodology in mind that this user evaluation document
will walk through a series of small demos after implementing each feature.
This will show feedback on very early ``proof of concept'' stages of
the app through to a more finished product as well as how the development
direction was shaped by this feedback cycle.

In chapter~\ref{chapter:features} we will see this feedback cycle for
all features developed in the time allowed for building the app and
in chapter~\ref{chapter:evaluation} we will describe a final evalation
of the product attained at the end.

\chapter{Features}
\label{chapter:features}
\section{Random pub nearby}
\subsection{Requirements}
The first requirement was to develop the core proposition that a user may
request the name of a random pub nearby. Additional information other than
the pub name was out of scope as was any specific design. The intent was
to capture the main functionality in the first user story such that
the app -- whilst lacking aesthetic polish and other desirable features --
is usable for its main purpose.

\subsection{Demo}

The user recognised the first feature illustrated the proof of concept
well. The app was technically already usable so long as the named pub
was known to the user, but it was noted that it would be very important
to consider adding further information about the pub as it is capable
of naming one the user does not know.

The lack of any attention to layout or aesthetics was noted, but it was
accepted this first iteration was not focused on the design yet and it
still demonstrates the concept well. It was decided that the most
value would be gained from the next iteration by adding enough
additional pub information to help someone find a pub they do not know.

\section{ Address of the pub is given}
\subsection{Requirements}

The second requirement was simply to add additional information such as
the street address of the pub underneath its name when it is suggested.
Some thoughts around layout were to be considered as well.

\subsection{Demo}

Simply placing the pub name in the centre of the screen in a larger font
was seen to be an improvement over small text aligned in the top-left
by default. The address being in a smaller font was better for giving
visual separation of the pub name from the address.

The user saw the addition of the street address a very valuable improvement
as the app is somewhat more practical when you are told where the pub is.

\section{Show directions to the suggested pub}
\subsection{Requirements}

The idea behind the third feature was to expand on the usability gained
from the second feature by linking out to Google Maps to give walking
directions to the pub. Whilst the addition of the pub's address will
help someone look the pub up for themselves, it is a small improvement
and a convenience to the user to link to full directions with the press
of a single button.

\subsection{Demo}

The user was happy with the convenience gained by linking to Google Maps
with the press of a single button. This was deemed to make the app into
a usable state in that a pub can be suggested and directions to it given,
completing the user journey for the app's primary purpose. It was decided
that the next most useful improvement would be to allow some control over
the pub search radius.

\section{Ability to change radius of the pub search}
\subsection{Requirements}

This feature's aim was to allow the beginning of some level of customisation
of the app's main function. Some users may only want pubs suggested
immediately nearby and some may be keen on a longer stroll. This was to be
achieved with a circle on the first screen that the user can pinch-zoom
to reduce or expand the search radius.

\subsection{Demo}

The radius selector circle was deemed to be a useful feature and the fact
it changes colour from green (very near pubs) to red (pubs some distance
away) was noted as a positive addition.

It was also noted that it would be more useful if the circle were backed
by a static map to aid the visualisation of distance. This feature was
added to the backlog of potential improvements.

\section{Ability to request another pub suggestion}
\subsection{Requirements}

The objective with this feature was to allow a user to ``roll again'' and
request another pub if they do not like a particular suggestion. It was
decided to implement this both as a button and also as an accelerometer
feature that detects the device being shaken.

\subsection{Demo}

This feature was welcomed as a useful addition. The ability to change
the suggestion to another one was seen as a core feature in order
for the app to be usable. The experience was noted to be quick and
easy to go through several suggestions.

One issue raised was that as the app progresses through several new
activities for each new suggestion, the only way to return to the main
screen with the radius selector is then by pressing the back button
several times.

Another issue is that there is no feedback as to how many pubs there are
in total in the search area, so it is not easy to tell if you are
getting the same suggestion multiple times due to randomness or
because there are not that many pubs within the radius given.

Both of these issues were added to the backlog.

\section{Saving favourite pubs}
\subsection{Requirements}

The purpose of this feature is to allow a basic ability to mark certain
pubs as favourites. When a favourite pub is then suggested at a later
date, the user is reminded that this is one they enjoyed. A list
was also added to allow deletion.

\subsection{Demo}

The user enjoyed the star icon marking a favourite pub and noted
that the feature worked as designed. The feature served its purpose
as a reminder well, but had no further purpose above that. The user
felt they would get more out of the feature if they were able to see
favourites marked by others and things like lists of most popular
pubs in an area. This would require an Internet-based service, but
it is a feature to consider for the longer term.

It was also noted that the favourite status of a pub did not factor
into the random suggestions. It was suggested that favourites could
appear more or less frequently and perhaps the user could have some
controls to adjust this.
