\chapter{Introduction}

Given the iterative, \emph{Agile} approach taken in developing the app,
user demoing and evaluation was able to take place at each iteration of the
software. It is with this regular feedback that the development is able
to adapt to user needs and suggestions. It is not uncommon for planned
features then to be dropped or prioritised differently after each
iteration demo.

It is with this methodology in mind that this user evaluation document
will walk through a series of small demos after implementing each feature.
This will show feedback on very early ``proof of concept'' stages of
the app through to a more finished product as well as how the development
direction was shaped by this feedback cycle.

In chapter~\ref{chapter:features} we will see this feedback cycle for
all features developed in the time allowed for building the app and
in chapter~\ref{chapter:evaluation} we will describe a final evalation
of the product attained at the end.

\section{Feature \#001: Random pub nearby}
\subsection{Requirements}
The first requirement was to develop the core proposition that a user may
request the name of a random pub nearby. Additional information other than
the pub name was out of scope as was any specific design. The intent was
to capture the main functionality in a the first user story such that
the app -- whilst lacking aesthetic polish and other desirable features --
is usable for its main purpose.
